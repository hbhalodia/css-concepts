		Grouping selectors #
		A selector doesn't have to match only a single element. You can group multiple selectors by separating them with commas:
		For example : strong, em, .my-class [lang] { color: red; }
		<br />
		Pseudo-classes( : )  and pseudo-elements( :: ) #
CSS provides useful selector types that focus on specific platform state, like when an element is hovered, structures inside an element, or parts of an element.
		<ul>
			<li>RED</li>
